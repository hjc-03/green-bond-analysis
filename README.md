# 🌱 Green Bond Performance and Market Reaction Analysis

This project analyzes the financial and market behavior of green bonds compared to conventional bonds. It is divided into two parts:

- **Part I**: Long-term performance comparison (returns, risk, and ESG)
- **Part II**: Short-term market reactions to green bond announcements (event study)

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Determine if green bonds differ in yield, volatility, or risk-adjusted returns
- Measure the stock market reaction to green bond issuance announcements
- Use real financial data and professional tools to answer these questions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, yfinance
- **SQL**: Data querying and preprocessing
- **Tableau / Power BI**: Interactive data visualizations
- **GitHub**: Version control and project showcase
